Hey everyone! If you're looking to integrate **GASP 5.5.1** with **Ninja GAS and Ninja Input**, this project is a great starting point! It sets up a **basic handler using interfaces**, so you can get rolling without too much hassle.  

### **How to Get Started**  
1. **Download Everything** – Grab the project files.  
2. **Install Ninja GAS & Ninja Input** – These plugins **must** be installed in Unreal Engine first!  
3. **Open the Project** – Either:  
   - **Double-click** on `NinjaGASPProject.uproject` in the folder.  
   - **OR Clone it with GitHub Desktop** and open it from there.  

### **🔥 New: Ninja Combat Branch! 🔥**  
- This branch adds a **simple sword system** using **Ninja Combat**.  
- **Important:** If you switch to the `NinjaCombat` branch, you'll need **Ninja Combat, Ninja GAS, and Ninja Input installed** for it to work.  

### **Fixing Plugin Errors**  
If you **don’t** have Ninja Combat installed but still want to open the project:  
1. **Go to the project folder** and find `NinjaGASP.uproject`.  
2. **Open it with a text editor or code editor** (Notepad++, VS Code, etc.).  
3. **Remove the lines referencing the combat plugin** (or set them to `false`).  
4. **Save and open the project in Unreal**.  

Now you're good to go! Have fun, break things (in the game, preferably), and experiment! 🚀
